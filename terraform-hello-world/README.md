# Mission 4: Introduction to Terraform

## Objective

The objective of this mission was to learn the foundational concepts and the core workflow of Terraform, the industry-standard tool for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This was accomplished by defining and creating a simple local file, which allowed for a clear focus on the tool's process without the complexity of a cloud provider.

## Terraform Code (`main.tf`)

The following code was used to declare the desired state of our infrastructure. It defines one resource: a single local text file with specific content.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    local = {
      source  = "hashicorp/local"
      version = "2.4.0"
    }
  }
}

resource "local_file" "hello" {
  filename = "${path.module}/hello.txt"
  content  = "Hello, Terraform! I am now managing this file. Congratulations!"
}
The Core Terraform Workflow
The entire process was managed using three fundamental commands that represent the core workflow for all Terraform projects:

terraform init: This command prepares the workspace. It reads the code, identifies which plugins (called "Providers") are needed, and downloads them. In this case, it downloaded the hashicorp/local provider.

terraform plan: This command performs a safe "dry run." It compares the code blueprint to the real world and creates a detailed execution plan. It shows exactly what will be created, changed, or destroyed, allowing for a final review before any changes are made to the infrastructure.

terraform apply: This command executes the plan. After asking for a final yes confirmation, Terraform takes the necessary actions to make the real world match the code blueprint. In this mission, it resulted in the hello.txt file being created with the specified content.

Execution Plan
The following output was generated by the terraform plan command, showing that one resource was planned for creation.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.hello will be created
  + resource "local_file" "hello" {
      + content              = "Hello, Terraform! I am now managing this file. Congratulations!"
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "./hello.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
